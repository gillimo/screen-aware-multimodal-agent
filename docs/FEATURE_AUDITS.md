# Feature Audits

## Perspective 1: Brand-New OSRS Player

What I want:
- A clear onboarding path from tutorial to first 10-20 hours.
- Simple explanations of why quests/unlocks matter.
- A safe money plan that avoids risky deaths.
- A checklist that tells me exactly what to do next.

Gaps and missing tools:
- No tutorial-island to early-game pathing guide.
- No “start here” wizard to set goals and choose playstyle.
- No beginner quest bundle (e.g., optimal 10-quest starter track).
- No food/armor recommendations by level for safe training.
- No basic money methods for level 1-40 skills.
- No “avoid this for now” warnings (dangerous areas, scams).
- No step-by-step gear loadouts for early combat styles.
- No “how to unlock teleports early” checklist.
- No explanations for common terms (prayer, overheads, safe spot).

## Perspective 2: Seasoned Player

What I want:
- Efficient unlock routing for specific goals (quest cape, diaries, bossing).
- Accurate boss/raid readiness and gear breakpoints.
- ROI-focused money/skill methods with time estimates.
- Clear dependency graph for high-tier unlocks.

Gaps and missing tools:
- No endgame boss/raid readiness scoring with mechanics/gear checks.
- No detailed quest/diary dependency map (full dataset).
- No configurable efficiency benchmarks (xp/hr, gp/hr).
- No gear upgrade optimizer (best value per gp).
- No time-to-goal estimator using real method rates.
- No Ironman-specific constraints (buy vs craft).
- No activity scheduler for daily/weekly content (farm, birdhouse, Tears).
- No risk calculator for death cost vs benefit.
- No comparison between multiple progression paths.
