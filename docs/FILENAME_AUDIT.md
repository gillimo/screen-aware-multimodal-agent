# Filename Audit

Scope: projects/agentosrs folder.

## Findings
- Removed legacy numbering from tickets file; standardized to `TICKETS.md`.
- Renamed `DEMO_MODE.md` to `DEMO.md` to avoid mode ambiguity.

## Rationale
- `V2_` labels imply versioning that does not map cleanly to release stages; a neutral `TICKETS.md` is clearer for a template.
- Demo documentation is kept because it is useful for quick smoke tests, but naming is simplified.

## Keys and Secrets
- No API keys or secrets found in filenames.
- Avoid placing secrets in docs or code; keep local-only config outside repo.
